        		I am a confident individual with over a decade of experience of working in first line technical support and customer service.  Customer service, troubleshooting and support come as second nature, meaning I am able to resolve many issues without further assistance. I also have some experience building websites and creating documents in both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator having started a web design course at City of Glasgow College. I do various hobby projects to work on my skills in these areas.
